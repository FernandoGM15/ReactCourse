### Styled Components

    React offers us the possibility of create a HTML element with a component's sintaxis, and add it some CSS properties.
    In short write, we can add the css code in each react component.

#### Advantages

    - If we stop using a component, its css code will be cleaned up too.

### Custom hooks

    Sometimes you'll need to create some custom hooks to reuse functions that are defined already.
    A state can be added in a custom hook, and keep the value of a function in a persistent way.

#### Advantages

    - Your custom code will have all the react api functions as: state, effect, hooks integration and the performance will be improved.

    - Can be reused in another projects.

### API

    An API (Application Programming Interface) is a group of functions or methods that a library offers to be used by a software as a abstraction cap.
    It provides some resources that are hosted in a server or a database.
    Usually the response data will be retrieved in JSON format.
